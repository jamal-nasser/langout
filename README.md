## app description 
Langout is a platform where a user, who wants to learn a new language, can make a profile and connect with other people. 

Upon making a profile, the users mention what languages they speak, and what language they want to learn. The language they can speak will be the language they can teach to someone else, and that's how users will connect with each other and exchange knowledge. 
For example, if I can teach English and I want to learn Dutch, I can connect with someone who can teach Dutch and wants to learn English. 

Languages aren't necessarily spoken, they can also be coding languages or sign languages. Whatever the language is, Langout is the place to be.

After logging in, the user can connect with someone by sending them an email. The user can also make a post to share tips and tricks about learning a new language.

Langout can be used on your computer at home or from anywhere on your mobile phone.
